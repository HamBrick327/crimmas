  <p>quick and dirty christmas <s>17th birthday</s> list website because my ideas started expanding outside of amazon</p>
  <p>I could make this page look better, but that's a lot of work and the eye-searing orange color is without flaw</p>
  <h1>NON AMAZON ITEMS</h1>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="">a windshield :)</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h1>AMAZON</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>legos are always cool</li>
    <li><a href="https://a.co/d/7M8qKeK">Tool adapter thing</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://a.co/d/hmgphW4">Soldering thing, of course</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://a.co/d/amG0P72">Winter cover for automotive excellence</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://a.co/d/h7QAhmn">A metric tape measure because all my hobbies use metric</a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
  </ul>

<p>this was made because two reasons: My ideas started leaving the scope of amazon, and I found a way for amazon to tell me if someone got me something off my wishlist, so I also made this to keep myself honest</p>
