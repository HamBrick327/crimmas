  <p>quick and dirty christmas <s>17th birthday</s> list website because my ideas started expanding outside of amazon</p>
  <p>I could make this page look better, but that's a lot of work and the eye-searching orange color is perfect anyways</p>
  <br>
  <p>I wrote half of this at midnight without my glasses on so it guarenteed doesn't look good</p>
  <h1>NON AMAZON ITEMS</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Gonna copy avery now</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>AMAZON</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>legos are always cool</li>
    <li><a href=https://a.co/d/g1nNPpO">Maybe the rest of the audio upgrade</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CPSMPKKZ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A1YDKIV8XPI80A&th=1">Not sure I have an explanation for this one</a></li>
    <li><a href=""></a></li>
  </ul>

<p>this was made because two reasons: My ideas started leaving the scope of amazon, and I found a way for amazon to tell me if someone got me something off my wishlist, so I also made this to keep myself honest</p>
